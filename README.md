# A Github-Portfolio in VueJs

This is the Vuejs version of my [github portfolio](https://github.com/OnshilAgassi8/github-portfolio/) originally built in React. It is also my submission to the [Alt School](https://altschoolafrica.com/schools/engineering) third semester's first assignment.

## Overview

### Project question

*Create a new vue js application then using the GitHub API, fetch your GitHub repositories using this endpoint https://api.github.com/users/{{USERNAME}}/repos. show a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub(the page should have some form of pagination). Then create another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes. Make sure to implement a wildcard route to catch 404 pages. NB: Good UI and Designs are important.*

## My process

### Built with

- React commponents, props, useState, useEffect, createBrowserRouter, fetch API

### What I learned

- Adding routes to react apps using React Router v6
- Implementing SEO using `meta`
- Depolying React Routed sites to netlify
- Implementing pagination using the GitHub API
- Creating error boundaries and implementing error pages


### Continued development

This was my first time working with most of the concepts I used in building the project. I plan to learn more about APIs, React Hooks and implementing SEOs.
